Balanced tree
    rotation cases
    BST on disk impacts data locality as new child node could be far from parent
    disk DS tree needs :: high fanout (no of child nodes) , low height (reduce seeks)

Hard disk drives: Head position - > sector 
Solid State drives: memory cells -> strings ->arrays -> pages-> block (planes placed on die)

        Leaf node :data ........................................

        Leaf node can have sibling pointers(or dbl pointers) for easier range scans
