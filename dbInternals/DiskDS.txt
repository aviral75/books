CurationTargets are like disks based storage
Campaigns , Role Guides are like virtual memory that we expose to application developers
While we spcify offsets inside target file we specify cohorts in CurationTargets and then interpret 

Design on-disk structures
    -take care of GC n fragmentation ourselves
    -Serialization n deserilaztion
    -create effiecient page layout on disk with read() n write() instead of malloc()

Bitwise operator
    Set the bit use | and <<(bitshift)
    unset the bit usr & ~ n then <<
    test bit & or <<

Principles
    Use same size pages for read/write to file (header,page1...page n,trailer)
    pages can be single block or mulipte contingous blocks for data
    flush page from memory to disk when full 
    Page checksums (like CRC for multibit soft err check) written and when read computed to match
